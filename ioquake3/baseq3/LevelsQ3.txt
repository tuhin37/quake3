Directions:

Place the pk3 file into your baseq3 directory, load up Q3, go into Skirmish
and find the map, and yer ready to rock!

INTRO:

This map is a conversion from the Quake 2 map "Levels" by Vertigo5.
Unfortunately I could find no info on this person, so I cant give any more
due credit to them than a big THANKS!

Yes this is a "simple box map", I am fully aware of that. =) Levels for q2 was a box map, so therefore this one is also. Of course once you realize that space maps are box maps as well, the whole "box map opinion" thing gets kinda fuzzy and gray. =P

The idea for doing this came from Pumpaloaf.
Levels for Q2 was one of my all time favorite rail only maps, and had to be
redone for Q3. So now we have a map that is more "roundy" and more "bouncy"
like all good Q3 maps should be. =)

Miscellaneous Stuff:

	Feel free to let me know what you think of the map, as this is my first real
	Q3 map. I did some maps for Q2 but they were all just junk, not worth mentioning.

	If you use this map on a server, then let me know and I will come play ya!
	Just make sure you use "dmflags 8" in the game to disable falling damage.
	I considered using a common/cushion brush to cover the two different levels,
	but I figured it would be better to leave it up to the players/admins. Some
	people like having the falling damage on this map, some hate it (me!) So I
	leave it up to you!

	If you are wondering why the hell I used Wordpad as one of the creation programs,
	it was because I used the find/replace function in Q3R to change over a texture,
	but I screwed it up somehow. So rather than going around looking for every
	fubar texture I just edited the .map file in wordpad, worked well enough.
