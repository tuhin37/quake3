Hey,
Collected within are my second attempts at q3a skinning. None of them are totally original so props go out to all the id guys.

Included are:
Warmachine   -ironman's ally made using the keel model
Bishop             -"the last x-man" using sarge
Kingpin            -the x-tra large nemesis to dardevil and spidey, using the biker model
Rogue             -the xmen's southern belle courtesy of mynx
Sabretooth     -this homicidal maniac is broght to you by grunt

I could say "u must get permission to alter these skins etc" but then i'd be a hypocrite wouldn't i?

check out www.swut.net for more funky shit.
