Hey,
Collected within are my latest and i reckon greatest attempts at q3 skinning. This should be my last MARVEL pak but keep yer eyes peeled. None of them are totally original so props go out to all the id guys.

There are seven skins this time. Deadpool was originally by witz for the q3test but was altered abit and fixed for q3 by me with permission from witz.

YOU MUST HAVE THE PMS AND CONNI MODELS FOR MYSTIQUE AND BLACK WIDOW TO WORK
get them at www.planetquake.com/polycount/

Included are:
Magneto                                        -Eric Magnus Leschner, the master of magnetism for the ranger model
Deadpool [by witz & snafu]       -Wade Wilson, the merc with a mouth for sarge
Havok                                            -Alex Summers, in his old red and black costume using bitterman
Mutant-X                                       -Havok in his current costume also by bitterman
Mystique                                        -Raven Darkholme brought to you in PMS form
Colossus                                        -Piotor Rasputin, the steel russian, comes you to in grunt flavour

I could say "u must get permission to alter these skins etc" but then i'd be a hypocrite wouldn't i?
