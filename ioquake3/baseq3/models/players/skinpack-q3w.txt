NOTES:

Basically, this was to be a 'Christmas' skinpack for the folks at www.quake3world.com that wanted some skins. 
But, as all projects go, sometimes it gets longer than intended. I have also made it so these skins are separate 
.pk3's so if there's one a particular person doesn't want to use, all they have to do is delete it.

Included Skins:

1. Visor- Cold Fusion (Honorable Mention Winner in the 'Skin My Ash' contest on PlanetQuake) My current personal skin.
2. Visor- Heresy (for Grandpa Stu)
3. Visor- Death Knight (for Vikingo)
4. DOOM- Massive Deth (for SiCDeth)
5. Slash- GoaGrrl (For GoaGrrl...duh)
6. Crash- Isis (for SumJackass's girlfriend)
