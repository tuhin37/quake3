Map description         : Multi-level floating platforms connected by stairs. Three jump-pads
			  shoot you to an island in the sky with Protect. I triple-
			  checked this level and made sure that nobody had any big advantages
			  as far as powerups and fragging is concerned.
			  
			  The second Quake 3 Arena map that I have made. Many more to come.
			  I'm finally gettin' the hang of Q3A!
            
Thanks to               : id (who Epic Games really can't compete with),
			  and Tom Mustane, Iikka Keranen, Ty Halderman and all of the other map
			  makers out there that have greatly influenced my life in
			  the mapping world for 5 years so far.

* How to use the .pk3 *

Put it in your BaseQ3 folder in your Q3 directory.
It should be listed as a "free for all"/"Tourney"/"Team Deathmatch" map in the game.
...Or for all of you dedicated server-type guys, the map is "q3matt2".
