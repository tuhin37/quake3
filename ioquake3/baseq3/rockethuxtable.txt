--------------------------------RocketHuxtable ----------------------------
-----------------------------Final Release Version-------------------------

Installation:
Simply put the rockethuxtable.pk3 into your quake3/baseq3 folder.

Examples include:
	C:\Program Files\Quake 3 Arena\baseq3\
in my case, because Program Files is a stupid folder, I have:
	C:\q3\baseq3\
the full directory should be something like:
	C:\q3\baseq3\rockethuxtable.pk3


Dedication:

I was going to dedicate a section of RTMG2 to the short life lived by Type O Negative's lead singer, Peter Steele, but instead of doing just that, I figured I'd dedicate an entire level to his memory.  (and that chunk of RTMG2)

Notes:

As far as I know, this map should not require any special memory allocation.  This map is ONLY configured for FFA-type playing.   Come to think of it, Capture the flag would have been really dumb on this map.  Really dumb.  ....I might have to experiment with that later on.

I used to just want to watch bots duke it out on this map, so originally visor was added to the ".arena" file, but under normal play, this caused problems as it's a 4 person map.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this with the world, I made my own fog.
It's pretty fun and it's not insanely huge like RTMG1 was, so you can move and interact and stuff.

Development:

This is my first map that was designed, built, compiled, and completed on the new computer I built to finish RTMG2 (still in progress).

AMD T1055 Phenom ][ X6 @ 2.8GHz
MSI Nvidia 460GTX
MSI 870A-G54 Motherboard
4GB of OCZ ram

I only used NetRadiant, Q3Map2 2.5.17 and BSPC.

Final compile settings were:

-bsp -meta
-vis -fast
-light -fast -super 2 -filter -bounce 12 -bouncegrid

the aas file was compiled with:

-forcesidesvisible and -nocsg

This map was not optimized in any way for bot performance, the same map the player sees is the exact same map the bots see.
